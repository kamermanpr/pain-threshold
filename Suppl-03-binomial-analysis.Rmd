# Question
For each participant, and at each stimulus intensity, does the distribution of SPARS, NRS, or SRS ratings differ significantly from a theoretical 'NULL' distribution?

To answer the question, we used the binomial test. The binomial test is an exact test of the statistical significance of deviations from a theoretically expected distribution of observations into two categories. As such, using the test required that we dichotomize the continuous rating data we collected (generally not a good thing, but here it is appropriate). 

The SPARS ranges from -50 ('no sensation') to +50 ('most intense pain you can imagine'), and therefore ratings can span 0 (pain threshold, 'the exact point at which you feel transitions to pain'). We therefore coded SPARS ratings < 0 as being **'negative'**, and ratings > 0 as being **'positive'**. In the first SPARS experiment (SPARS A), participants were not allowed to record a stimulus as 0 , but in the second SPARS experiment (SPARS B), they could record stimuli as 0 on the scale. We felt that the 0 ratings in the SPARS B experiment were uninformative, and so we excluded ratings of 0 from the analysis (we describe the number of zero ratings per participant below). 
The NRS ranges from 0 ('no pain') to 100 ('most intense pain you can imagine'), and therefore ratings immediately to the right of the 0-point of the scale mark the transition from non-painful to painful sensation. We therefore coded NRS ratings = 0 as being **'negative'**, and ratings > 0 as being **'positive'**. In addition, it has been reported that individuals use the first 15 points of a 0 to 100 NRS to record non-painful stimuli (NEEDS A REFERENCE), and so we also analysed the NRS data with NRS ratings $\leq$ 15 as being **'negative'**, and ratings >15 as being **'positive'**.

The SRS ranges from -100 ('no sensation') to 0 ('just painful/pain threshold'), and therefore ratings immediately to the left of the 0-point of the scale mark the transition from non-painful to painful sensation. We therefore coded SRS ratings = 0 as being **'positive'**, and ratings < 0 as being **'negative'**.  

In all cases, we modelled the data using the binomial test with a 50% probability of 'success' (positive rating arbitrarily chosen as success). This is a conservative approach as one would expect that for the SPARS and the NRS, as stimulus intensity increases above pain threshold, the probability of recording a 'positive' rating increases. Similarly, in the case of the SPARS (which allows the rating of intensity of noxious and non-noxious stimuli), one would expect that the probability of recording a 'negative' rating would increase as stimulus intensity decreased. However, since we did not know the approximate intensity of a theshold stimulus, and there was high inter-individual variation in sensitivity, we were unable to gage at which stimulus intensities we should start shifting the probability of 'success' away from 50% (see Supplement 1 and Supplement 2). 

Because ratings on the SPARS can range from -50 to +50, we analysed the data using a two-tailed p-value. That is, the distribution may shift to the left or right of the theoretical distribution. However, because the NRS has a floor rating of 0 ('no pain') and the SRS has a ceiling rating of 0 ('pain threshold'), the change in rating from 0 is unidirectional (> 0), so we performed the binomial test with a one-tailed p-value. For all test, significance was assessed at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 level. And, because this was an exploratory analysis, we did not make any family-wide corrections for multiple comparisons.

## Plot

# SRS (zero: -15 to 0)

There is no evidential basis to repeat the SRS analysis using a -15 to 0 range as being **'positive'**, but for comparative purposes to the analyses done for the NRS, we performed the analysis of the SRS using the expanded definition of pain threshold.
