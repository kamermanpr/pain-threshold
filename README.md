# Pain threshold

### Generate PDF copies of supplementary files 

## Information

**Do not merge this branch with _master_**

This branch of the _pain-threshold_ repo was used to generate PDF copies of the supplementary files referenced in the _pain-threshold_ mansucript. Minor changes were made to the YAML and the body of _*.Rmd_ scripts to generate PDF outputs. The names of these files use the format: _Suppl-\*.pdf_, where _\*_ is an integer followed by a string identifying the file.
